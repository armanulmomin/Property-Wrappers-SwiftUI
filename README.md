This SwiftUI project demonstrates how to use various **property wrappers** in SwiftUI, such as:

- `@State`
- `@Binding`
- `@ObservedObject`
- `@StateObject`

It is intended to help beginners understand the purpose and behavior of these wrappers through simple, practical examples.

- Two-way binding between parent and child views using `@Binding`
- Managing shared data using `@ObservedObject` and `@StateObject`
- Propagating data across multiple views with `@EnvironmentObject`
